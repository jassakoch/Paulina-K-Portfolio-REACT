## Description

This project is a single-page application (SPA) that showcases my portfolio as a web developer. Motivated by the desire to present my work in an organized and interactive manner, I built this portfolio to highlight my skills in developing single-page applications using React. This project solves the problem of showcasing a variety of work samples in a concise and user-friendly format. Throughout the development process, I learned advanced React techniques, enhanced my CSS styling capabilities, and refined my ability to create responsive layouts.
